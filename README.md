Project Title: Odin Recipes
Description
Odin Recipes is a simple HTML-based project that showcases a collection of recipes. The homepage, index.html, serves as the entry point and lists the available recipes with links to their respective pages. Each recipe page provides a detailed description, list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish. This project is designed to demonstrate basic HTML structuring and linking.
